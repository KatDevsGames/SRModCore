# SRModCore
Core shared functions to make modding Synth Riders easier

## For Developers - Adding to a project
- Download the latest version from the Releases tab
- Right click References in your project, and Add Reference. Browse to the dll you downloaded (you'll need to unzip).
- Include the SRModCore.dll file in your mod release

See SRPerformanceMeter, SRVoting and SRPlaylistDownloader for example usages. Note that after adding the .dll to the Visual Studio project, I changed the file's properties to "Copy Always", which is why the scripts work.
